# Calculus Problem Sets – Based on _Paul's Online Math Notes_

This repository contains my organized solutions and study notes for the Calculus I course from [Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx). It serves as a personal study log and problem set archive as I work through key concepts and example problems to deepen my calculus intuition and technical fluency.

## Resource Used

All problems are taken from:
**Paul Dawkins’ Calculus I** – Lamar University  
[https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx)

## How I'm Solving

Most problems are:
- Solved **by hand** on paper
- then typed using Markdown for  future reference
- Accompanied by concise notes to clarify **why** a solution works

The goal is **not speed**, but **mastery**—this is part of my long-term technical foundation building under my [Project10X Calculus](#) effort.

## Work In Progress

This repository will grow gradually as I move through the course. Some sections are under development or may only contain partial solutions.

---

## Tools Used

- Markdown + Git for clean version control
- LaTeX (when needed) for math notation
- Diagrams drawn manually or with Geogebra

## License
